# Demo repository

Katie asked to come and talk about Github and Git.
I said OK because Piko is cute and she is my friend.

This repository is a demo of what can be done on Github.

This is how you make bullet points:

* Point 1: use a `*` simbol

Enumerate things:

1. Thing 1
2. Thing 2

The command for clonning the repository is `git clone ...`
